This repository contains a calorie and macro tracking SwiftUI application for iOS 26.
The app features a chat-based interface powered by Apple Intelligence for logging food,
a daily tracking view with meal breakdowns, and historical analysis over weeks/months.
All data is stored locally in SQLite. The Makefile provides tasks for building, testing
on an iPhone 16 simulator, listing available schemes and deploying the app. The CI
workflow on GitHub Actions uses these tasks to verify the project.
